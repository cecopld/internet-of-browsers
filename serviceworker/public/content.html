      <h1>Service Worker Playground</h1>
      <p>Using service worker you can hijack connections, fabricate,
      and filter responses. Powerful stuff. While you would use these
      powers for good, a man-in-the-middle might not. To avoid this,
      you can only register for service workers on pages served over
      HTTPS, so we know the service worker the browser receives hasn't
      been tampered with during its journey through the network.
      Github Pages are served over HTTPS, so they're a great place to
      host demos.</p>
